COGS189 OpenMIIR Classification Project 
============================
> Used the [OpenMIRR dataset](https://github.com/sstober/openmiir).
> Group Name: __Glissando-Goblins__

We want to study how brain waves differ between the types of music that participants listen to, specifically to the absence of lyrics in music. We also want to observe if brain waves vary or remain uniform between listening sessions that contain similar types of music. 

__Classification Goal__: Using an SVM, predict whether a participant is listening to a lyrical or nonlyrical song based on the snippet of EEG data corresponding to when that song was played.

Preprocessing methodology heavily followed the preprocessing steps discussed in [(Stober* 2017)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01255/full).
